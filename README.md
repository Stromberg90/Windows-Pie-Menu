# Windows-Pie-Menu

After running the program, the default hotkey is __Ctrl+Alt+Q__ to open the pie menu at the cursors position, left click to close it without triggering a action.

Which after moving the mouse a certain distance away from the pie menus center, it will trigger the item that's on the line between the current cursor position and the pie menu center.
